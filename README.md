# Git Connect 

**GitConnect** is an interactive AI powered web app that lets you **talk to any public GitHub repository** using an **LLM (Large Language Model)**. With just a repo URL, you can **explain code**, **suggest modifications**, and **analyze repositories** like never before.

## Features

- **Talk to Code**: Ask questions about a repositoryâ€™s structure, logic, or implementation. The LLM responds in natural language.
- **Modify Files with AI**: Request code edits, improvements, or optimizations. AI will suggest changes and filenames.
- **Explain Code**: Get detailed explanations of functions, files, or entire repositories.
- **Code Analytics Dashboard**:
  - Language usage distribution
  - Commit activity over time
  - Contributor statistics
  - Code complexity estimates
- **Repository Viewer**: View repo structure, README, and file previews.
- **Compare Repositories**:
  - Purpose, tech stack, community engagement
  - Side-by-side commit activity, language breakdown, and contributor data
- **LLM Suggestions**: Automatically suggests filenames and code snippets based on user queries.

GitConnect makes it easy to understand, modify, and compare complex codebases using AI, helping developers save time and work smarter.
